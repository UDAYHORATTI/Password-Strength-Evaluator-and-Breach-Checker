# Password-Strength-Evaluator-and-Breach-Checker
This project combines the concepts of password security and user awareness. It evaluates the strength of a password based on its complexity and checks if the password has appeared in known breaches using the Have I Been Pwned API. This helps users understand the importance of using strong, uncompromised passwords.
